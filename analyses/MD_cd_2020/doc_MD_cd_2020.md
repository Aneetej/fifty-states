# 2020 Maryland Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
[In Maryland, districts must](https://governor.maryland.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/execorder.pdf):

1. be contiguous (C.1.a.i.)
1. have equal populations (C.1.c.i.)
1. be geographically compact (C.1.a.iv.)
1. preserve county and municipality boundaries as much as possible (C.1.a.iii.)
1. not consider incumbent or partisan informat (C.1.b.i., C.1.b.ii.)


### Interpretation of requirements
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources
Data for Maryland comes from the ALARM Project's [2020 Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).

## Simulation Notes

No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
