# 2010 Georgia Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Georgia, districts must:

1. be contiguous
2. have equal populations
3. be geographically compact
4. comply with VRA section 2
5. preserve political subdivisions and communities of interest 
6. avoid pairing incumbents

### Algorithmic Constraints
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources
Data for Georgia comes from the ALARM Project's [2010 Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for Georgia.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
