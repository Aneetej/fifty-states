# 2020 Arkansas Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Arkansas, there are no state law requirements for congressional districts.

### Interpretation of requirements
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%, which is in line with the low deviation seen in past congressional district maps.
We limit the number of county/municipality splits, which is in line with the small number of county/municipality splits observed in past congressional district maps.

## Data Sources
Data for Arkansas comes from the ALARM Project's [2020 Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).
Data for Arkansas' 2020 congressional district map comes from All About Redistricting's [Maps for Download](https://redistricting.lls.edu/mapdownload/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for Arkansas across two independent runs of the SMC algorithm.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
