# 2020 South Carolina Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In South Carolina, according to the State House Redistrcting committee ([House link](https://redistricting.schouse.gov/docs/2021%20Redistricting%20Guidelines.pdf), [Senate link](https://redistricting.scsenate.gov/)), districts must:

1. be contiguous (including contiguity by water)
1. have equal populations
1. be geographically compact
1. preserve boundaries of counties, municipalities, voting tabulation districts, cores of previous districts, and other communities of interests as much as possible
1. preserve separation of incumbents as much as possible




### Interpretation of requirements
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources
Data for South Carolina comes from the ALARM Project's [2020 Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for South Carolina.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
