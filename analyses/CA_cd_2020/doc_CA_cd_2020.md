# 2020 California Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In California, districts must:

1. be contiguous
1. have equal populations
1. be geographically compact
1. preserve county and municipality boundaries as much as possible


### Interpretation of requirements
We enforce a maximum population deviation of X.X%.

## Data Sources
Data for California comes from the ALARM Project's [2020 Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for California.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.

Alameda County, Contra Costa County, Fresno County, Kern County, Los Angeles County, Orange County, Riverside County, Sacramento County, San Bernardino County, San Diego County, San Francisco County, San Joaquin County, San Mateo County, Santa Clara County, and Ventura County are larger than the target population.
