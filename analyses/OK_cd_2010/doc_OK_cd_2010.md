In Oklahoma, districts must:

TODO: Complete this part 
1. be contiguous
1. have equal populations
1. be geographically compact
1. preserve county and municipality boundaries as much as possible


### Algorithmic Constraints
We enforce a maximum population deviation of X.X%.

## Data Sources
Data for Oklahoma comes from the ALARM Project's [All About Redistricting](https://redistricting.lls.edu/state/oklahoma/?cycle=2010&level=Congress&startdate=2011-05-10)


## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for Oklahoma.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
