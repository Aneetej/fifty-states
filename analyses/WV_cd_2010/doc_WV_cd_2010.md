# 2010 West Virginia Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
[In West Virginia, under the state constitution, districts must](http://www.wvlegislature.gov/WVCODE/WV_CON.cfm):
1. be contiguous (I 1-4)
1. have equal populations (I 1-4)
1. be geographically compact (I 1-4)
1. districts must be made of contiguous counties (I 1-4)

### Interpretation of requirements
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources
Data for West Virginia comes from the ALARM Project's [Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for West Virginia across 4 independent runs of the SMC algorithm.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
