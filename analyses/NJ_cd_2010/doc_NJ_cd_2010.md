# 2010 New Jersey Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In New Jersey, districts must:

1. have equal populations
2. comply with section 2 of the voting rights act

### Algorithmic Constraints
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources
Data for New Jersey comes from the ALARM Project's [2010 Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for New Jersey.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
