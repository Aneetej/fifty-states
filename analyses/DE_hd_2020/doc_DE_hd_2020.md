# 2020 Delaware House of Representatives Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Delaware, districts must:

1. be contiguous (29 Del. C. § 804).
1. be nearly equal in population (29 Del. C. § 804)
1. be bounded by major roads, streams or other natural boundaries (29 Del. C. § 804)
1. not be created so as to unduly favor any person or political party (29 Del. C. § 804)
1. count currently incarcerated individuals who were residents of Delaware before incarceration at their last recorded address, rather than at the prison they currently inhabit (29 Del. C. § 804A)

### Interpretation of requirements
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.
