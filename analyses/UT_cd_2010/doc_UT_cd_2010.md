# 2010 Utah Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Utah, there are no state law requirements for congressional districts.

### Interpretation of requirements
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.
We limit the number of county/municipality splits.

## Data Sources
Data for Utah comes from the ALARM Project's [Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for Utah across two independent runs of the SMC algorithm
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
