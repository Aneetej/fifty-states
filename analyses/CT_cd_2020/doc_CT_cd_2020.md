# 2020 Connecticut Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Connecticut, there are no state law requirements for congressional districts

### Interpretation of requirements
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%, which is in line with the low population deviation observed in the 2000 and 2010 congressional district plans.

## Data Sources
Data for Connecticut comes from the ALARM Project's [2020 Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for Connecticut.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
