# 2020 Virginia Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Virginia, districts must, under Va. Code Ann. ยง 24.2-304.04:

1. be contiguous
2. have equal populations
3. be geographically compact
4. preserve county and municipality boundaries as much as possible
5. "not, when considered on a statewide basis, unduly favor or disfavor any political party"

### Interpretation of requirements
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources
Data for Virginia comes from the ALARM Project's [2020 Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for Virginia.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
