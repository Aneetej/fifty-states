## Redistricting requirements
In North Carolina, under [North Carolina State Constitution Article II Sections 3 & 5](https://www.ncleg.gov/Laws/Constitution/Article2), districts must:

1. be contiguous
2. have equal populations
3. be geographically compact
4. preserve county and municipality boundaries as much as possible

Using racial data in NC redistricting is prohibited.


### Interpretation of requirements
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources
Data for North Carolina comes from the ALARM Project's [2020 Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/). Data for the 2021 North Carolina ratified congressional map comes from the [North Carolina State Board of Elections](https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data/voting-maps-redistricting).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for North Carolina.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
