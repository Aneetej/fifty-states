# 2010 Illinois Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Illinois, districts must:

1. have equal populations
2. comply with VRA section 2


### Algorithmic Constraints
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources
Data for Illinois comes from the ALARM Project's [2010 Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for Illinois.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
